This project written in Java manages exams, using a database to store all the system's data(using postgres). The users of the system are lectures which can add questions to the system in the subjects that they teach.
Lecturers can create exams using questions in the same subject, manually or automatically. The lectures can edit their own questions and exams at any point, and can even export their exams to txt files
which they can send to their students.
